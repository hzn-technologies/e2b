# How the smol agent specific deployment works
- Deploy button in repo opens page `/agent/smol-developer`
- On this page user signs in with GitHub
  - We need to fix GH Apps vs OAuth Apps for the sign in - we need GH App access token to retrieve repos that were given permissions by the user
- User selects repo to deploy
  - They can also modify permissions for our GH App if we don't have access to repo they want to use
- User adds initial prompt that specifies what should smol dev do in the first iteration
- User specifies their OpenAI key and clicks on "Deploy"
- Then we create a PR throught the GH API
- We then create agent deployment for the specific repo
  - The necessary GH data are in the `auth` field in the deployments table
  - The OpenAI key is included in the `config` field alongside the model configuration
  - We also add informations about the PR that was created so we can update the branch connected to the deployment via git pushes in the agent dev environemnt
- During each agent run we authenticate with GH App token, pull the repo, make the changes necessary and then push the changes to the branch connected to the deployment
- On each comment to the PR we trigger a webhook that compiles the prompt from the PR description and comments and then triggers a new run of the smol agent
  - If the smol dev agent is already processing previous PR change we cancel that run and then start a new one with the latest changes
