# Analyze data with AI

You can use E2B Sandbox to run AI-generated code to analyze data. Here's how the AI data analysis workflow usually looks like:
1. Your user has a dataset in CSV format or other formats.
2. You prompt the LLM to generate code (usually Python) based on the user's data.
3. The sandbox runs the AU-generated code and returns the results.
4. You display the results to the user.
