# API Reference

This is the API reference for the E2B CLI, JS & Python packages, which allows you to run AI-generated code in secure isolated sandboxes in the cloud. 

The reference is intended to be limited to low-level descriptions of various programmatic functionality. If youâ€™re just getting started with E2B, we would instead recommend looking at the [documentation](../docs) first or to get started quickly with an example.
