# Connect LLMs to E2B
E2B can work with any LLM and AI framework. The easiest way to connect an LLM to E2B is to use the tool use capabilities of the LLM (sometimes known as function calling).

If the LLM doesn't support tool use, you can, for example, prompt the LLM to output code snippets and then manually extract the code snippets with [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).
