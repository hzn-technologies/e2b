# Results explained

The object returned by the `execCell` method is little bit more complex, it's based on Jupyter. (there's an detailed explanation in the [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html).

It contains the following fields:

- `data`: An array of the output of the cell and also displayed data (e.g. plots or images)
- `logs`: Logs printed to stdout and stderr during execution.
- `error`: An error message, if there was an error during execution of the cell. It works only for Python code, not for system (`!`) commands.
