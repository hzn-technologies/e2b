# Code Interpreter

The Code Interpreter template runs a Jupyter server inside the sandbox, which allows for sharing context between code executions.
Additionally, this new template also partly implements the Jupyter Kernel messaging protocol. This means that, for example, support for plotting charts, rendering DataFrames, etc.

## Motivation

The code generated by LLMs is often split into code blocks, where each subsequent block references the previous one. This is a common pattern in Jupyter notebooks, where each cell can reference the variables and definitions from the previous cells. In the classical sandbox each code execution is independent and does not share the context with the previous executions.

This is suboptimal for a lot of Python use cases with LLMs. Especially GPT-3.5 and 4 expects it runs in a Jupyter Notebook environment. Even when ones tries to convince it otherwise. In practice, LLMs will generate code blocks which have references to previous code blocks. This becomes an issue if a user wants to execute each code block separately which often is the use case.

This new code interpreter template runs a Jupyter server inside the sandbox, which allows for sharing context between code executions.
Additionally, this new template also partly implements the [Jupyter Kernel messaging protocol](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html). This means that, for example, support for plotting charts is now improved and we don't need to do hack-ish solutions like [in the current production version](https://github.com/e2b-dev/E2B/blob/main/sandboxes/code-interpreter/e2b_matplotlib_backend.py) of our code interpreter.

The current code interpreter allows to run Python code but each run share the context. That means that subsequent runs can reference to variables, definitions, etc from past code execution runs.

## Installation

You can install the code interpreter using the following commands:

<CodeGroup isRunnable={false}>
```bash {{ language: 'js' }}
npm install @e2b/code-interpreter
```
```bash {{ language: 'python' }}
pip install e2b-code-interpreter
```
</CodeGroup>

## Features

- **Stateful Execution**: Unlike traditional sandboxes that treat each code execution independently, this package maintains context across executions.
- **Displaying Graph & Data**: Implements parts of the [Jupyter Kernel messaging protocol](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html), which support for interactive features like plotting charts, rendering DataFrames, etc.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Interactive Code Interpreter**: Run code snippets and share context between them.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze data and visualize it using charts.
