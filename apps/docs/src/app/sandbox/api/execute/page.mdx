# Code Execution

You can use E2B SDK to safely execute code generated by LLM inside the sandbox. {{ className: 'lead' }}

### 1. Run the LLM-generated code using the low-level sandbox.process module {{ className: 'lead' }}

This approach gives you more control over the underlying sandbox and the running process. You can for example stream stdout and stderr, or kill the process that's running the code.

<CodeGroupAutoload
  path="code_exec/process"
  isRunnable={true}
