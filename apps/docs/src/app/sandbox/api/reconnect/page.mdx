# Connect to running sandbox

Disconnect and reconnect to the same sandbox {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Description

The sandboxes are by default kept alive only when connected to them. When you disconnect from a sandbox, it will be destroyed.

If you want to keep the sandbox alive even after disconnecting from it, you can explicitly say for how long you want to keep it alive. You can then disconnect from the sandbox and reconnect to it later. This can be useful for example in a serverless environment or chatbot application.

The duration limit is 1 hour. If you need more, feel free to [reach out to us](/getting-help) with your use.

## Keep sandbox alive

The example below shows how to disconnect from a running sandbox and reconnect to it again while keeping the sandbox alive.

<CodeGroupAutoload
  path="reconnect/reconnect_1"
  isRunnable={false}
/>

Call the `keep_alive` method on the sandbox instance to keep it alive. You can specify a red duration, as a multiple of a default time unit, which is
- 1 ms in JS
- 1 s in Python.

You then disconnect from the sandbox.

<CodeGroupAutoload
  path="reconnect/reconnect_2"
  isRunnable={false}
/>

You can then reconnect to the sandbox from anywhere.

<CodeGroupAutoload
  path="reconnect/reconnect_3"
  isRunnable={false}
/>
