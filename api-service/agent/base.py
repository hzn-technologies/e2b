# The schema for agent config and interaction data is serializable and
# the format for interactions with the agent is based on a modified JSON-RPC 2.0 spec (should we use less modified JSON-RPC?).

# This way is to have a schema for communication and a tools that can for example take
# the implementation of AgentBase class and generate REST server that implements the schema
# that then be deployed on our platform.

# For local testing there can be a CLI that takes the implementation of AgentBase class
# and just starts the server and exposes the functionality with a pre-made web UI where you can test the agent immediately.

# Later we can start supporting other ways to generate the server, for example a gRPC or WS server.
# This is orthogonal to the environment where the agent is deployed.
# The agent can still be deployed as a Python task, in a Firecracker VM, as a docker container, etc.
