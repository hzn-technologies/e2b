- You have access to the following tools:"""

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """"The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
THE ONLY VALUES THAT SHOULD BE IN THE "action" FIELD ARE: {tool_names}. NO OTHER VALUES ARE ALLOWED.
The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}
```
ALWAYS use the following format:


Instructions: the input instructions you must implement
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final code that satisfies all the input instructions. THE FINAL ANSWER IT MUST BE JUST THE CODE."""
