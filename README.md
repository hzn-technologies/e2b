[e2b](https://e2b.dev) (_english2bits_) is like AWS for AI agents. Our goal is
to build a developer-first platform that helps developers to build reliable AI
agents.

E2b allows developers to debug, test, deploy, and monitor their AI agents.

# How e2b works

E2b is made of three parts:

1. Infrastructure
2. Cloud dashboard (this repo)
3. [SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/sdk)

Every agent deployed on e2b gets their own [small virtual machine](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker) that works as a playground for the agent.

# ü§î What is this repo?
This repo is the cloud dashboard of e2b. The e2b dashboard is where you can manage and inspect your AI agents. Think about it like devtools for your browser. The agents themselves currently runs on e2b infrastructure that isn't open-sourced at this moment.

# üöÄ Get started

You can start e2b's cloud dashboard locally via docker.

## üê≥ Start e2b with Docker

You will need:

- Docker
- Node.js _16+_
- Free ports 3000 (Next.js app), 54321 (Supabase API Gateway), 54322 (Supabase
  Database)

To start e2b run:

```
npm start
```

Then open page on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

`npm start` starts local Supabase in the background - to stop it you have to run
`npm run stop`.

## üíª Development setup

For developing with hot reloading and contributing to the project you may want
to run the app locally without Docker (`npm start` command).

[Follow these steps](DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) to set it up.
