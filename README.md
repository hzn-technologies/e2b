# Next-gen IDE (name about to change)

<NAME> is a new kind of development environment powered by AI. The main idea is that developers have access to AI agents that can use tools. The developer writes a short documentation or a technical spec in plain English and then lets the AI agent do the actual work. The AI agents have access to tools like writing to a file, running code, running commands, installing dependencies, deploying, etc. Agents operate in a secure sandboxed cloud environment that's powered by [Firecracker](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/). This way, you for example describe what a server route should do and the agent codes it for you.

## Current state
<NAME> is a work in progress. The `developer <---> AI agent` cooperation creates completely new paradigms. We're exploring how the ideal UX, UI, and cooperation with the agents should look like. The app will surely go through a lot of changes in the short and medium term.

## Building in public
One of our core ideas is to allow anybody to bring their models, customize the prompts, and develop custom tools for agents. We also want to offer a hosted cloud version.

## Pricing
You will always be able to self-host <NAME> for free. The current idea is to offer the base cloud version for free while having some features for individuals behind a subscription. We'll share more on pricing for companies and enterprises in the future.
